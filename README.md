## 📐 Design Principles

**1. Frictionless by default** — Check-ins should take under 3 seconds. No bloated UI.

**2. Celebrate progress, not perfection** — Missing one day is okay. The app never punishes, always encourages.

**3. Smart without being creepy** — AI insights feel helpful, not intrusive. Privacy is a first-class feature.

**4. Built for humans** — Accessible, inclusive design. Supports multiple languages from day one.
